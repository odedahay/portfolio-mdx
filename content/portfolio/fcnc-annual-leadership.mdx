I designed and developed this landing page for the 4th Annual FCNC Leadership Convention & National Gala 2025, an event that brings together Filipino-Canadian leaders, advocates, and changemakers. The goal was to create a professional yet vibrant online presence that highlights event details, keynote speakers, and sponsorship opportunities while driving registrations.



**Key Features**
+ Hero Section: Bold branding with event title, date, and quick details (Convention & Gala schedules) supported by a strong call-to-action (“Register Now”).
+ Event Highlights: Concise introduction emphasizing the theme—Empowering Filipino Leaders: Building Capacities, Bridging Communities, Driving Change.
+ Speaker Section: Showcase of keynote speakers with headshots, bios, and “Read More” links for deeper engagement.
+ Program Details: Quick access to the full schedule via a clear call-to-action button.
+ Sponsorship Packages: Tiered options (Gold, Silver, Bronze) presented in easy-to-read cards with benefits and inquiry buttons.
+ Contact Section: Direct contact information for organizers, making it simple for potential sponsors and participants to connect.
+ Footer: Includes organization details, quick links, and social media icons for broader reach.

**Design Approach**
+ Color Palette: Strong use of red, blue, and white to align with Filipino heritage and event branding.
+ Typography: Clear hierarchy for readability and professional appeal.
+ Layout: Clean grid system with balanced white space, ensuring accessibility and mobile responsiveness.
+ User Experience: Prioritized quick navigation, prominent CTAs, and scannable information flow for busy professionals.


**Outcome**
The landing page provided a centralized hub for registration, sponsorship, and event information, helping the FCNC reach a wider audience and streamline event promotions.
