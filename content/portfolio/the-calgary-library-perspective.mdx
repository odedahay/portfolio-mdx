This week, I visited the Calgary Public Library to observe its architecture firsthand and explore concepts of depth, perception, and perspective. My goal was to analyze this world-famous library from multiple vantage points and apply perspective design principles to deepen my understanding. Below, I’ll share my creative process and the insights I gained.


**Sketching with Perspective**
The library’s striking architecture—featuring layered floors, dynamic angles, and captivating views—immediately inspired me. I focused on a section of the building and sketched it using one-point perspective, positioning the vanishing point at the center of the scene. This approach emphasized the structure’s symmetry and guided the viewer’s eye toward the heart of the composition.

**Digital Rendering in Adobe Illustrator**
To translate my sketch into a digital format, I used Adobe Illustrator and experimented with its Perspective Tool. This tool allowed me to maintain accurate proportions and depth while refining the architectural details. The final digital drawing highlights the interplay of light, shadow, and geometry that defines the library’s design.
