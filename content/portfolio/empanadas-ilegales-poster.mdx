The band, based in Montreal, Canada, originally hails from Latin America (as noted on their social media). Their music blends jazz with other genres, and I love how they incorporate humor into their live shows, making their performances even more enjoyable.

I enjoy jazz music and often play it as background music to stay energized, focused, and entertained. This Empanadas Ilegales band poster I included an "empanada" bread icon, though it's not their official logo. After noticing variations of this icon on their social media, I decided to create my own version.

My poster design combines street art, retro diner vibes, and outlaw energy. At the center is an oversized empanada with the band name, "Empanadas Ilegales," in a custom, eye-catching font. "Empanadas" is bold and textured, while "Ilegales" has a jagged, graffiti-style look, almost like glowing signage lights. I arranged the band members in a movie-poster style to match the design’s flow. Finally, at the bottom, I added different variations of vector objects to streamline the event details and ensure they don’t clash with the band’s name design.
