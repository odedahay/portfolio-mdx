Tinkerbox Child Development Centre is a licensed daycare providing nurturing care for children aged 12 months to 5 years. While their current website (tinkerboxchildcare.com) offers basic information, its plain yellow design and minimal structure make critical details difficult to find. As a designer tasked with improving their online presence, my goal is to transform it into a fully informative yet visually engaging platform that reflects the warmth of their childcare services.

**Current Pain Points**
+ Visual Design: The monochromatic yellow scheme lacks visual hierarchy and fails to establish trust.
+ User Experience: Key information (programs, enrollment, staff credentials) is buried in dense text blocks.
+ Mobile Readability: The site isn’t optimized for parents browsing on-the-go.

**Proposed Solutions**
+ Color Psychology: Introduce calming blues/greens with yellow accents to balance energy and professionalism.
+ Information Architecture: Reorganize content with clear sections (Programs, FAQs, Testimonials) and a sticky enrollment CTA.
+ Visual Storytelling: Add high-quality images of classrooms and activities to showcase the daycare’s environment.
+ Accessibility: Ensure WCAG compliance for text contrast and screen reader compatibility.

This redesign will prioritize both aesthetics and functionality, helping Tinkerbox communicate their value proposition while making critical information easily accessible to busy parents.

**Stack and Tools Used**
+ Design Process: Figma, Illustrator, Photoshop
+ Front-End & Back-End Development: HTML, CSS, PHP and Customise Wordpress Theme

### Planning
**Streamlined Daycare Sitemap**

![Sitemap](/images/portfolio/tinkerbox-sitemap.jpg)


This sitemap highlights essential pages (green boxes) for daycare visibility and user experience: About Us, Programs, Parent Resources, Contact Us, and Blog/Events. The intuitive structure helps parents quickly find information with clear menu labels and logical grouping—avoiding overwhelming layouts.

The Blog section boosts SEO and engagement by featuring:

+ Parenting tips
+ Daycare updates
+ Educational content

This organization ensures visitors easily navigate key information while learning about your school's specialties.

**Optimized Wireframe for Intuitive Navigation**

This wireframe prioritizes discoverability, ensuring parents easily find key information while building confidence throughout their journey. The layout guides visitors through a logical flow with strategic CTA placements that encourage action.

Every section—from header to footer—features prominent, decision-friendly CTAs. For instance:

+ The Hero section uses engaging visuals to create immediate warmth
+ Clear messaging communicates the daycare's purpose within seconds

This intentional structure:

+ Reduces decision fatigue with visible next steps
+ Maintains visual consistency
+ Converts interest to action through frictionless design

By eliminating guesswork, the wireframe helps parents focus on what matters most: their child's care.


### UX/UI Design

**Design Concept - Typography & Color Scheme**

I selected playful yet modern typography:
+ Headings: Friendly rounded sans-serif (approachable)
+ Body/Subheadings: Clean sans-serif (readability)

![Moodboard](/images/portfolio/tinkerbox-moodboard.jpg)

Visual elements include:

- Diverse children in learning activities
- Vibrant school-inspired backgrounds
- Rounded line icons (fun, playful tone)
- Interactive buttons for cohesion


**Website Design**

The color palette evokes calm happiness, reinforcing the daycare’s nurturing environment. This mood board synthesizes all components—typography, imagery, icons, and colors—into a cohesive style tile to guide the website’s design.
