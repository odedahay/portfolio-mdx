The MAS-Jesuits.org website was designed as an informative hub for Jesuit priests, educators, scientists, and professionals, as well as those discerning a vocation. The clean, intuitive layout ensures easy access to key sections like About Us, Mission, and Resources, while a muted color scheme and professional typography reflect the Jesuit identity.

The project began with wireframing and prototyping in Adobe XD and Illustrator to refine the user experience. The final design balances simplicity with functionality, ensuring accessibility across devices. For development, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a responsive front end, while WordPress powers the back end for seamless content management.

Visual assets were crafted in Photoshop, maintaining consistency with the Jesuit brand. The result is a user-friendly platform that supports their mission in education, science, law, and spirituality—bridging tradition with modern digital needs.

**Website Design**

The site uses a restrained, meaningful color scheme inspired by Jesuit tradition. white and grey conveys trust and solemnity, while warm green accents reflect wisdom and spiritual richness. Soft neutrals provide balance, ensuring readability and a serene aesthetic. This palette reinforces the Jesuit identity—rooted in heritage yet forward-looking.
