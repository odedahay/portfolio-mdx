EOB Systems Integrator Inc. is a systems integrator company specializing in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems. The company provides a wide range of services, including engineering design, supervision, installation, commissioning, testing, coordination, and assessment of all electronic engineering equipment.

**Project Overview:**
The EOB website was designed to provide users with a comprehensive overview of their products, ranging from complex system setups to simple installations using the correct devices.

**Project Scope:**
+ Company branding development
+ Social media strategy
+ Company website: https://eobsystems.com

**Stack and Tools Used:**
+ Design Process: Photoshop, Adobe XD, Illustrator
+ Front-End Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
+ Back-End Development: Django, PostgreSQL

### Design Process:
As the sole designer and developer, I was responsible for the entire process, from sitemap creation to wireframing, mockups, and final development.

### Planning:
During the initial requirement-gathering phase, we identified that organizing EOB’s products was a significant challenge. To address this, I carefully designed a categorization system that replicated the UI, aesthetics, and functionality across client requirements. By grouping products logically, I solved this problem, ensuring that EOB’s clients could easily understand the systems and engineering services offered.

### Delivery:
I designed the EOB website with a dominant blue color tone to emphasize the company’s branding. Each component was crafted to provide clarity about the company’s services and offerings. The header menu was simplified to enhance user navigation, while the most critical aspect of the website—the product categorization—was showcased prominently to highlight EOB’s offerings.
