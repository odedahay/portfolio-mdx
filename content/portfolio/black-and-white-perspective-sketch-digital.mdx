**Sketching with Perspective**

Initially, I wanted to show the tree here because—I'll be honest—when I sketched it, I felt really confused. I redrew it many times, over and over, trying to understand how the branches split from single to double as they grew upward. I really love these details!

**Digital Rendering in Adobe Illustrator**

I used Adobe Illustrator to digitize my sketch. Enjoy!
