The title of my piece is “The Starry Night in Calgary.”
It is inspired by Van Gogh’s iconic painting, Starry Night, reimagined in the context of Calgary.

This piece with the thought of Van Gogh in the modern day, imagining him leaving Calgary. It reflects how many people are suffering and facing various life crises. The message behind this work is one of hope—a depiction of the struggles with mental illness and the resilience to persevere.

The light from the stars and the windows of buildings serves as a guide, leading people through the darkness.

The swirling sky symbolizes our inner turmoil; however, it also reminds us that there is still hope, and life is a journey that must continue.

For this piece, I sketched and coloured everything directly in Illustrator.
